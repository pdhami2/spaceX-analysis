1. Earthquake Data https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/
- How many earthquakes of at least 5 magnitude happened in and around Tonga in May of 2017?
 
2. SpaceX Launch Data https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/wiki
- In which year did SpaceX first successfully reuse a capsule?
- Which flights used core Merlin 1C?
- Transform the launch data into the relational tables and document the model
